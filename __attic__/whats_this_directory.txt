Former versions of the dvpd compiler used a database as implementation platform.
Although a lot of that was replaced by the python compiler version, some libraries and utitly
scripts are kept here in the attic, to be not forgotten.

Nevertheless, everything here is not functioning, not documented and not needed for the dvpd implementation to run.
